## Fast-and-frugal classification in R (ffcr)

The *ffcr* package constructs two transparent classification models: _fast-and-frugal trees_ and _tallying_ models. The book _Classification in the Wild: The Science and Art of Transparent Decision Making._ (Katiskopoulos et al., 2020) describes these models, their applications and the algorithms to construct them in detail. 

A fast-and-frugal tree is a decision tree with a simple structure: one branch of each node exits tree, the other continues to the next node until the final node is reached. A tallying model gives pieces of evidence the same weight. This package implements several methods for training these two models, ranging from simple heuristics to computationally more complex cross-entropy optimization (Rubinstein, 1999).



## Installation

The package can be installed with the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcusbuckmann/ffcr")
```
Alternatively, Windows users can download the binary file [ffcr_1.0.zip](https://github.com/marcusbuckmann/ffcr/blob/master/ffcr_1.0.zip) and install it from the hard drive.




## Training fast-and-frugal trees

We start by training a fast-and-frugal tree on a medical data set, predicting whether patients have liver disease (Ramana, Babu, and Venkateswarlu, 2011; Dua and Graff, 2017). The data set is included in the package. 

```{r}
library(ffcr)
model <- fftree(diagnosis~., data = liver, use_features_once = FALSE, method = "greedy", max_depth = 4)
```

The structure of the tree and its performance is shown by printing the model.

```{r}
print(model)
```


To visualize the tree we use 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(model)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="", fig.align= "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/tree.png")
```



To make predictions according to the fast-and-frugal tree, we can use the `predict` function. 
```{r}
pred <- predict(model, newdata = liver[1:10,])
pred
```

## Training tallying models

To train tallying models, we use the *tally* function. To make predictions we use the same command as for the fast-and-frugal trees.



```{r}
model <- tally(diagnosis~., data = liver, max_size = 4)
print(model)
pred <- predict(model, newdata = liver[1:10,])

```


Please consult the vignette and the documentation of the package for more details on how to use it. The book _Classification in the Wild_ provides background information on fast-and-frugal trees and tallying models.
