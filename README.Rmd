## Fast-and-frugal classification in R (ffcr)

The *ffcr* package allows the construction of two families of transparent classification models: _fast-and-frugal trees_ and _tallying_ models. The book _Classification in the Wild: The Science and Art of Transparent Decision Making._ (Katiskopoulos et al., 2020) describes these models, their applications and the algorithms to construct these in detail. 

A fast-and-frugal tree is a decision tree with a simple structure: one branch of each node exits tree, the other continues to the next node until the final node is reached. A tallying model gives pieces of evidence the same weight. The package implemts several methods for training these models, ranging from simple heuristics to computationyll more complex cross-entropy optimization (Rubinstein, 1999).


There exist an alternative excellent R package to train fast-and-frugal trees, [FFTrees](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees).


## Installation

You can install ffcr using from this GitHub page with

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcusbuckmann/ffcr")
```
or download the Windows Binary _ffcr_1.0.zip_ and install it from your hard drive.


## How to use the package


To illustrate the functionality of the package, we use a medical problem, predicting which patients have a liver condition. We start with loading the package and the data (Dua & Graff, 2017; Ramana, Surendra & Venkateswarlu, 2011), which is included in the package.



```{r}
library(ffcr)
data(liver)
```



## Training fast-and-frugal trees

We start by training a fast-and-frugal tree on the Liver data set. If the first column in the data set is the class label, we can simply pass the data set as the first argument. 

```{r}
model <- fftree(liver, use_features_once = FALSE, method = "greedy", max_depth = 4)
```

The model object shows the structure of the trees and its performance on the data set.

```{r}
print(model)
```


To visualize the tree we use 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(model)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="", fig.align= "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/tree.png")
```



To make predictions according to a fast-and-frugal tree, we can use the `predict` function. 
```{r}
predict(model, newdata = liver[301:nrow(liver),], type = "metric")

```

## Training tallying models

To train tallying models, we use the *tally* function.



```{r}
model <- tally(liver, max_size = 4)
```

Please consult the vignette of the package for more details on the functionalities of the package and the book _Classification in the Wild_ for background information on fast-and-frugal trees and tallying models.
